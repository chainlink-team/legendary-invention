# PowerPlay
PowerPlay is a decentralized gaming and financial services platform that combines the power of DeFi, AI, and GameFi. Our goal is to provide a safe, secure, and transparent platform for users to play games, engage in gambling, and access financial services without the risk of fraud or exploitative practices.

## Key Features

### Social Aspect (SocialFi)
- **AI-Generated NFT Profiles**: Users can create unique NFT profile pictures generated by AI based on keywords.
- **Community Leaderboard**: Compete on the community leaderboard to see top players and their achievements.
- **Profile Exploration**: Explore other players' profiles, recent activities, and ENS integrations.

### Gaming Aspect (GameFi)
- **European Roulette**: A fully functional European roulette game with various betting options.
- **Chainlink-Powered Fairness**: Chainlink VRF ensures random number generation, guaranteeing fair and transparent gameplay.
- **Automated Winnings**: Chainlink Automation calculates and transfers winnings to users' wallets automatically after each game.

### Lending Aspect (DeFi)
- **Cross-Chain Lending**: Users can deposit tokens on any supported chain as collateral to borrow LINK, facilitating seamless gameplay without selling existing holdings.
- **Real-Time Asset Prices**: Chainlink Data Feeds fetch the latest asset prices for accurate collateral valuation.

## How We Built It
PowerPlay was developed using a combination of Chainlink services and blockchain technologies:

- **Chainlink Functions**: Used to mint NFTs on Avalanche Fuji C-Chain with DALL-E3 (Open AI).
- **IPFS Server**: We built our own server to save costs and ensure smooth integration with our internal API, which stores NFTs and metadata.
- **Polygon Network**: Deployed the roulette game logic for fast transaction speeds.
- **Chainlink VRF**: Implemented to randomly generate winning values in the roulette game.
- **Chainlink Automation**: Used to automate the roulette wheel spin, calculate winnings, and withdraw winnings to users' wallets.
- **Chainlink CCIP**: Implemented Chainlink CCIP for cross-chain transfers and communication across chains to make it convenient for users and ease their struggle of jumping between chains.
- **Chainlink Data Feeds**: Employed to fetch the latest asset prices for calculating the maximum borrowable amounts in the lending contract and displaying up-to-date prices on the UI.
- **Scroll**: Deployed the DeFi aspect of PowerPlay on Scroll's Sepolia Testnet, leveraging its EVM compatibility to ensure seamless interaction with our smart contracts.
- **Metis**: Drew inspiration from existing GameFi applications on Metis and implemented features to merge gaming with financial blockchain mechanics.
- **Polygon Cardano**: Our MVP is deployed on the Polygon Cardano Testnet, featuring a functional frontend for seamless interaction with our smart contracts. This deployment leverages the scalability and compatibility of the Cardano zkEVM Testnet.
- **Polygon Amoy**: The lending feature of PowerPlay is deployed on the Polygon PoS network, utilizing its high throughput and low transaction fees to revolutionize financial services within our platform.
- **Avalanche Fuji C-Chain**: Deployed various aspects of PowerPlay on Avalanche Fuji C-Chain for its efficiency and robust infrastructure.

## Challenges We Ran Into
- **Integration of Multiple Chainlink Services**: Ensuring seamless integration of Chainlink Functions, VRF, Automation, and Data Feeds required careful planning and testing.
- **Cost Management**: Developing and maintaining our own IPFS server was cost-effective but required significant initial setup and ongoing maintenance.
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Deploying smart contracts across multiple chains and ensuring smooth interoperability was complex and demanded thorough testing and troubleshooting.
- **DeFi Implementation**: Setting up the DeFi part posed challenges, especially regarding the choice of tokens for the lending protocol.
- **Time Constraints**: Limited time prevented the implementation of gasless transactions and Lens protocol integration.
