export const rouletteTutorial = 'This is the European roulette variation, where there is only one 0 in the roulette (it is more favorable for you, as players!). There is a limit of $1,000 for every bet. First, enter a non-zero bet size. Then, click on parts of the board to make the appropriate bets. Clicking on an existing bet will overwrite it.
